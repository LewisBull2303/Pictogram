## User Stories

The back-end section of the Pictogram project focuses on its administration side and covers one user story:

As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit, and delete users, posts and likes, so that I can have control over the content of the application and remove any inappropriate content.

Users Model
The Profile model contains the following fields: username, bio, profile image, Followers.
One-to-one relation between the username  field and the user field in the posts model
Default profile image is used if no image is uploaded.
The bio is unable to be empty to avoid errors

Post Model
The Post model contains the following fields: user, post_image, created_at, likes
Foreign key relation with the Users


## Database: 
The following models were created to represent the database model structure of the application:

## Brief:

In the modern day, dont you think that there is too much of a focus on what other people think? When you see a new post on social media, one of the first things most people do, is to check the comments. Pictogram aims to solve this. Pictogram is a social media that aims to bring social media back to its roots, no comments, just pictures and likes taking out the the ability for people to be negative.

This website allows users to create accounts, sign in, edit their profiles to their liking, create new posts, like other users posts, and to search for their family and friends to follow them.

* Please note that https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://pictogram-project5-4fab6a1a47d8.herokuapp.com/ does not work with my project, this is an error with their website and not my project or deployment
