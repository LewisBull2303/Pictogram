## Backend:

[Live Website here](https://pictogram-project5-4fab6a1a47d8.herokuapp.com/)

## User Stories

The back-end section of the Pictogram project focuses on its administration side and covers one user story:

As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit, and delete users, posts and likes, so that I can have control over the content of the application and remove any inappropriate content.

Users Model
The Profile model contains the following fields: username, bio, profile image, Followers.
One-to-one relation between the username  field and the user field in the posts model
Default profile image is used if no image is uploaded.
The bio is unable to be empty to avoid errors

Post Model
The Post model contains the following fields: user, post_image, created_at, likes
Foreign key relation with the Users


## Database: 
The following models were created to represent the database model structure of the application:

## Technologies Used

**Languages and Frameworks**
 - Python
 - Django

**Libraries and Tools**
 - Cloudinary to store static files.
 - dj-database-url to access the database correctly
 - Git to upload changes to github
 - GitHub was used as a remote repository to store project code.

 - Pillow was used for image processing and validation.
 - Psycopg2 was used as a PostgreSQL database adapter for Python.
 - PostgreSQL â€“ deployed project on Render uses a PostgreSQL database.
 - Gunicorn to upload the project to Heroku


## Validation

**PEP8 Validation**

PEP8 Validation Service was used to check the code for PEP8 requirements. All the code passes with no errors or warnings.

## Testing

Comprehensive testing was conducted to ensure the robustness and reliability of my projects functionality. The testing process included manual testing all functions and features


## Manual Testing of User Stories

The manual testing of the user stories focused on ensuring that all functions and features work as expected. Each feature was tested rigorously for expeted outcomes and edge cases

| Test | Action | Expected Result | Actual Result |

## Project Goals:

In the modern day, dont you think that there is too much of a focus on what other people think? When you see a new post on social media, one of the first things most people do, is to check the comments. Pictogram aims to solve this.

    - Instant feedback when liking or following a user
 3. Deliver an exceptional user experience with:
    - Creative navigation and adaptive design across all devices
    - Features like Infinite Scrolling on the homepage and user search
 4. Enable users to customize their experience by:
    - Viewing and altering their own profiles and posts
    - Tailoring their feed with likes and follows

## Colours

The colour scheme for Pictogram was designed to convey the a warm, welcoming and familirar energy, while maintaining a modern and user-friendly aesthetic. The bold blue is the primary accent color. It is complemented by several neautral colors such as greys, whites and blacks. Additionally on some pages there are stark contrast with greens and reds for buttons and interactible items This all helps to give the website a modern and minimalist look, whilst maintaining a clean and enjoyable design

**Colour Pallete**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3adcd016-7ac8-465d-9d84-78627752197f)

These Colours were selected to:
 - Make the Pictogram pop and stand out as a social media app
 - Provide readability in the contrast of the colours
 - Ensure a consistant and recognisable standard of colours

**Implementation:**

 - I made the primary buttons blue, with red and green when needed for example with save changes and logout buttons
 - The neutral colors are used around the posts to bring out the vibrant colour in all of the users posts
 - Black was used to outline may items, which allows any colour inside the outline to pop
 - interactive elements had a consistant color of blue so the user knew what they could and could not use

The selected color palette ensures the application is visually appealing, consistent with Pictograms's branding, and provides an intuitive user experience.

## Fonts
Pictogram utilizes Segoe UI from Google Fonts for its sleek, modern design. Its slightly taller letterforms enhance readability, making it ideal for both headers and body text. When paired with a sans-serif fallback, Segoe UI maintains a polished and uniform appearance across all devices.
