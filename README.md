# Lewis Bull - Pictogram

## Brief:

In the modern day, dont you think that there is too much of a focus on what other people think? When you see a new post on social media, one of the first things most people do, is to check the comments. Pictogram aims to solve this. Pictogram is a social media that aims to bring social media back to its roots, no comments, just pictures and likes taking out the the ability for people to be negative.

This website allows users to create accounts, sign in, edit their profiles to their liking, create new posts, like other users posts, and to search for their family and friends to follow them.

* Please note that https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://pictogram-project5-4fab6a1a47d8.herokuapp.com/ does not work with my project, this is an error with their website and not my project or deployment
